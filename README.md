# College Fees Management Software

## Overview
The **College Fees Management Software** is a Java-based application developed in Eclipse, designed to streamline the management of student fees in educational institutions. This project enables administrators to manage student information, fee structures, payments, and reports efficiently. The software is built using **Swing** for the front-end, **JSP** pages for dynamic content rendering, and **JDBC** for database connectivity with **MySQL**.

## Features
- **Student Registration**: Allows registration of new students with detailed information.
- **Fee Management**: Manages fee structures, payment status, and dues for each student.
- **Login System**: User authentication to ensure secure access to the system.
- **Year-wise Student Lists**: Organizes and tracks students based on their academic year.
- **Reports**: Generates reports for fee payments, dues, and overall financial summaries.
- **Swing UI**: A graphical user interface built using Java Swing components.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Swing**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **JSP (Java Server Pages)**: For dynamic web content and rendering.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: For interacting with the MySQL database.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing student, fee, and payment information.
- **Eclipse IDE**: Development environment for writing and testing the code.

## Skills Developed
Through the development of this project, I was able to significantly enhance my Java development skills. I gained practical experience in:
- Building desktop applications using **Swing** components for the front-end.
- Working with **JSP** for integrating web-based content.
- Implementing **JDBC** for database interactions, connecting Java applications with a **MySQL** database.
- Managing multi-layered software architecture and improving problem-solving capabilities by developing a complete fees management system from scratch.
- Using **Eclipse IDE** efficiently to organize and run large-scale Java projects.
